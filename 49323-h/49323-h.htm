<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>John Phillips’ anonymous poem, <span class="u">A Satyr Against Hypocrites</span>, was
entered in the Stationers’ Register on March 14, 1654-55 as the work
of his brother Edward and the property of his publisher Nathaniel Brook,
and it was probably published on August 17 (David Masson, <span class="u">The Life of
John Milton</span> [London, 1877], V, 228n., cites the “Thomason copy” as
indicating the date of publication). Actually, two issues appeared in
1655. One gave no indication of the publisher and is reproduced here,
as perhaps the rarest, from the copy in the William Andrews Clark
Memorial Library. The other was “Printed for N.B. at the Angel in
Corn-hill.” The 1655 text was reprinted in 1661 as <span class="u">The Religion of
the Hypocritical Presbyterians in Meeter</span>, and a revised and enlarged
edition appeared in 1671 under the original title. It was this rather
than the original version which is known through the summary given by
William Godwin (<span class="u">Lives of Edward and John Phillips</span> [London, 1815], pp.
49-51) and quoted by Masson as the most “exact description” possible
of the 1655 “performance” (<span class="u">ibid.</span>, V, 228). Other editions have been
recorded for 1674, 1677, 1680, 1689, and 1710, the last being attributed
to the author’s uncle, John Milton. Of these, the editions which
I have seen show only minor revisions of the 1671 text. A holograph
manuscript, preserved in the Bodleian Library, includes a two-page
dedication to the successful barrister John Churchill, but the dedication
was apparently never printed.</p>

<p>Neither the unpublished dedication nor the poem itself contains
a clear indication of the purpose or the direction of the satire. In
pleading her case for John Phillips’ authorship of the anonymous life of
Milton, Miss Helen Derbyshire (<span class="u">The Early Lives of Milton</span> [London, 1932],
pp. xxii-xxv) has taken issue with the common statement that it marked
Phillips’ departure from his uncle’s teachings and has described it as
a satire against the Presbyterians from an Independent position with
which Milton might well have sympathized. Yet the text hardly supports
these contentions. The Sunday service which Phillips burlesques shows
no signs of Presbyterian discipline. In fact, sectarianism is almost
at its worst in his picture of a congregation crying destruction against
Covenant-breakers, making grinning appeals for free grace, and screaming
for the Fifth Monarchy in a state of revelation-madness. Furthermore,
the Brother Elnathan who makes his appearance at the dinner
following the Wednesday service received his name in a Baptist “Ducking-pond”
rather than from the customary Presbyterian sprinkling. There
may be some significance, too, in the fact that the particularly
satiric reference to “the man midwife,” Dr. Peter Chamberlain, was to
a noted Independent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the church specifically identified as the
scene of the weekday service was St. Mary’s Aldermanbury, and its
minister was the Reverend Edmund Calamy, whose inclinations were
Presbyterian and whose personally conducted fastday services were
notoriously popular. Although Calamy’s custom of preaching from the
desk rather than from the pulpit makes it unlikely that he was the
minister satirized in the early part of the poem, he would normally
have been identified as the object of Phillips’ most severe and
scandalous attack; and the device of having him refer to “the Laud”
instead of the Lord may have had reference to the rumors of early conformity
which still haunted Calamy despite his service to the Puritan
cause as one of the Smectymnuans and a member of the Westminster Assembly
of Divines. There is no evidence, however, that Presbyterianism as a
particular nonconformist sect stirred Phillips to any special antagonism.</p>

<p>In any case, it seems impossible to represent <span class="u">A Satyr Against
Hypocrites</span> seriously as a document of which John Milton would have
approved. If he could have tolerated the violation of the Scriptures
and the punning obscenity of his nephew’s introduction of the Prophet
Habakkuk into the poem, he might have felt a personal offense in the use
of such material for an attack upon the church in which he was to register
his espousal of the pure-minded Katharine Woodcock. At best, Milton
could have considered this first rhymed flowering of his nephew’s satiric
humor a pointless piece of scurrility which lacked real wit, coherence,
or character. If Phillips did not publish it in open recalcitrance, he
published it with less confidence in his uncle’s sympathy than in his
blindness and in the decent reluctance of friends to disclose the extent
of a young man’s departure from the paths of good instruction.</p>

<p>The republication of <span class="u">A Satyr Against Hypocrites</span> as <span class="u">The Religion
of the Hypocritical Presbyterians</span>, in 1661, was no more than an attempt
to attract new interest with a title which would appeal to the post-Restoration
tendency to condemn the strongest of the Puritan sects.
The incongruity between the new title and the old poem, though, seems
to have been more evident to the author than to later readers; for in
the 1671 edition he introduced a satire on the ceremony of infant baptism
which nullified the allusion to the “Ducking-pond” by making the Sunday
congregation, at least, clearly Presbyterian. The other major revisions
and additions were in the direction of greater licentiousness and more
frequent references to “the Laud.” The editions of 1680 and 1689 (which
are the only two later versions I have seen) are based upon that of
1671 and contain only such minor changes as might have been made by a
printer alert to the possibility of introducing new bawdy implications
by the change of an occasional word or letter.</p>

<p>The Bodleian manuscript is an approximate but not a true copy of
the version which was first printed. A few lines appear in the published
poem which are not to be found in the manuscript, the printed
marginal annotations are fewer in number and considerably changed, and
there are some differences in the musical notation. Except for an
indication that the old Robin mentioned at the beginning of the poem
was a particular “fool well known in the city,” however, the manuscript
annotations are similar in character to those printed and add little
to the comprehensibility of the text. The author’s signed dedication
to Churchill shows an inclination (like that revealed in the concluding
lines of the published text) to justify his poem as a defense of true
religion against the sectaries whose words and actions brought it into
contempt; but <span class="u">A Satyr Against Hypocrites</span> appears to have been, in reality,
little more than the irresponsible outburst of a young man of twenty-three
who was tired of discipline, disappointed in his expectations of
political preferment, and angry at the sort of people who had taken over
the country but who seemed incapable of appreciating his peculiar merits.</p>

<div class="verse">There sits a Lady fine, painted by Art,</div>

<div class="verse">Whom th’ Chaplain oft instructs without his Cassock:</div>

<div class="verse">Truly the Priest, though some did, saw her not,</div>

<div class="verse">O’th Sunday Levite when up stairs he march’t,</div>

<div class="verse">For my part, I know none like Dr. <i>Trig</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">Nay, hold you there sayes t’other, on my life</div>
<div class="verse">There’s none like <i>Chamberlain</i> the man midwife.</div>
<div class="verse">Then in a heap, their own receipts they muster</div>
<div class="verse">To make this gelly, how to make that plaster,</div>
<div class="verse">Which when she heares, but that now fainting lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Up starteth she, and talkes as fast as they.</div>
<div class="verse">But they that did not mind this dolefull passion</div>
<div class="verse">Followed their businesse on another fashion,</div>
<div class="verse">For all did write, the Elder and the Novice,</div>
<div class="verse">Me thought the Church look’t like the six Clerks office.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But <i>Sermon’s</i> done, and all the folks as fast</div>
<div class="verse">As they can trudge, to Supper now make haste:</div>
<div class="verse">Downe comes the Priest, when a grave Brother meets him,</div>
<div class="verse">And putting off his narrow-brimm’d hat, thus greets him:</div>
<div class="verse">Deare Sir, my Wife and I doe you invite</div>
<div class="sidenote">A great sign of grace.</div>
<div class="verse">O’ th’ Creature with us to partake this night:</div>
<div class="verse">And now suppose what I prepare to tell ye,</div>
<div class="verse">The City-dame, whose faith is in the belly</div>
<div class="verse">Of her cramm’d Priest, had all her cares in order,</div>
<div class="verse">That <i>Gracious-street</i>, or <i>Cheapside</i> can afford her.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Loe first a Pudding! truly ’t had more Reasons</div>
<div class="sidenote">Bill of fare.</div>
<div class="verse">Than forty Sermons shew at forty seasons.</div>
<div class="verse">Then a Sur-loyne came in, as hot as fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet not so hot as was the Priests desire.</div>
<div class="verse">Next came a shoulder of Mutton rosted raw,</div>
<div class="verse">To be as utterly abolishe as the Law.</div>
<div class="verse">The next in order was a Capon plump,</div>
<div class="verse">With an Use of Consolation in his rump.</div>
<div class="verse">Then came a Turky cold, which in its life</div>
<div class="verse">Had a fine taile, just like the Citizens wife.</div>
<div class="verse">But now by’r leave, and worship too, for hark ye,</div>
<div class="verse">Here comes the Venson put in Paste by <i>Starky</i>:</div>
<div class="verse">Which once set downe, there at the little hole</div>
<div class="verse">Immediately in whips the Parsons soule.</div>
<div class="verse">He saw his Stomacks anchor, and believ’d</div>
<div class="verse">That now his belly should not be deceiv’d.</div>
<div class="verse">How he leanes ore the cheere toward his first mover!</div>
<div class="verse">While his hot zeale doth make his mouth run over.</div>
<div class="verse">This Pastie had Brethren too, like to the Mayor,</div>
<div class="verse">Three Christmas, or Minc’d pies, all very faire.</div>
<div class="verse">Methought they had this Motto <i>Though they flirt us</i>,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>And preach us down, Sub pondere crescit virtus.</i></div>
<div class="verse">Apple tarts, Fooles, and strong cheese to keep downe</div>
<div class="verse">The steaming vapours from the Parsons crown.</div>
<div class="verse">Canary too, and Claret eke also,</div>
<div class="verse">Which made the tips of their eares and noses glow.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Up now they rise, and walk to their severall chairs,</div>
<div class="verse">When loe, the Priest uncovers both his eares.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="sidenote">Grace before meat.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Most gracious Shepherd of the Brethren all,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou saidst that we should eate, before the Fall;</div>
<div class="verse">Then was the world but simple, for they knew</div>
<div class="verse">Not either how to bake, or how to brew.</div>
<div class="verse">But happily we fell, and then the Vine</div>
<div class="verse">Did <i>Noah</i> plant, and all the Priests drank wine.</div>
<div class="verse">Truly we cannot but rejoyce to see</div>
<div class="verse">Thy gifts dispenc’d with such equality.</div>
<div class="verse">To us th’ast given wide throats, and teeth to eate;</div>
<div class="verse">To the women, knowledge how to dress our meat.</div>
<div class="verse">Make us devoutly constant in thy cup,</div>
<div class="verse">And grant us strength when we shall cease to sup,</div>
<div class="verse">To beare away thy creatures on our feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And not be seen to tumble in the street.</div>
<div class="verse">We are thy sheep, O let us feed, feed on,</div>
<div class="verse">Till we become as fat as any Brawne.</div>
<div class="verse">Then let’s fall to, and eate up all the cheer;</div>
<div class="verse">Straight <i>So be it</i> he cryes, and calls for beer.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="sidenote">Much good may doe you Sir.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Now then, like <i>Scanderbeg</i> he falls to work,</div>
<div class="verse">And hews the Pudding as he hew’d the Turk.</div>
<div class="verse">How he plough’d up the Beefe like Forrest-land,</div>
<div class="verse">And fum’d, because the bones his wrath withstand?</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the Mutton he fell not like a Lamb,</div>
<div class="verse">But rather like a Wolfe he tore the same.</div>
<div class="verse">At first a Sister helpt him, but this Elfe sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Wearying her out, she cryes, <i>Pray help your self sir!</i></div>
<div class="verse">Upon the Pasty though he fell anon,</div>
<div class="verse">As if ’t had been the walls of <i>Babylon</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">Like a Cathedrall downe he throwes that stuffe,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Why, Sisters</i>, saith he, <i>I am pepper-proofe</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">Then down he powres the Claret, and down again,</div>
<div class="verse">And <i>would the French King were a Puritan</i></div>
<div class="verse">He cryes: swills up the Sack, and I’le be sworn</div>
<div class="sidenote">Christian forgivenesse.</div>
<div class="verse">Quoth he, <i>Spaine’s</i> King is not the <i>Popes</i> tenth horne.</div>
<div class="verse">By this his tearing hunger doth abate,</div>
<div class="sidenote">No Grace after meat.</div>
<div class="verse">And on the second course they ’gan to prate.</div>
<div class="verse">Then quoth <i>Priscilla</i>, Oh my brother deare:</div>
<div class="verse">Truly y’are welcome to this homely cheare,</div>
<div class="verse">And therefore eate, good brother, eate your fill,</div>
<div class="verse">Alas for <i>Daniel</i>, my heart aketh still.</div>
<div class="verse">Then quoth the Priest, <i>Sister be of good heart</i>;</div>
<div class="verse">But she reply’d <i>good brother eate some Tart</i>.</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Rebecca</i> then a member of the ’lection</div>
<div class="verse">Began to talk of brotherly affection;</div>
<div class="verse">For this, said she; as I have heard the wise</div>
<div class="verse">Discourse, consisteth much in exercise.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet I was foolish, and would oft resist,</div>
<div class="verse">But you had more grace, Brother, than to desist.</div>
<div class="verse">Streight he reply’d, there is a time for all things,</div>
<div class="verse">There is a time for great things and for small things,</div>
<div class="verse">There’s a time to eate, and drink, and reformation,</div>
<div class="verse">A time to empty, and for procreation.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore deare Sister let us take our time,</div>
<div class="verse">There’s reason for’t, I never car’d for Rhyme.</div>
<div class="verse">Then truly answer’d she, tis a good motion,</div>
<div class="verse">And I embrace it with a warme devotion.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Nothing beyond ingratitude.</div>
<div class="verse">Why you know Brother you did never prove</div>
<div class="verse">That I was ere ingratefull for your love,</div>
<div class="verse">But sometimes Angels did attend your Purse,</div>
<div class="verse">At other times you know I did you nurse,</div>
<div class="verse">With many a secret dish of lusty meat,</div>
<div class="verse">And presently we went and did the feat.</div>
<div class="verse">Truly quoth <i>Dorcas</i> then, I saw a Vision,</div>
<div class="verse">That we should have our foes in great derision.</div>
<div class="verse">Quoth <i>Martha</i> straight (and then she shook the crums</div>
<div class="verse">From off her apron white, and pickt her gums)</div>
<div class="verse">So I doe hope, for so our Brother said;</div>
<div class="verse">O what a heavenly piece of work he made!</div>
<div class="verse">But I am ign’rant, and my memory short,</div>
<div class="verse">I shall forget, were I to be hang’d for’t.</div>
<div class="verse">Then quoth the Priest, The cheere that here we see,</div>
<div class="verse">Is but an Emblem of Mortality.</div>
<div class="verse">The Oxe is strong, and glories in his strength,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet him the Butcher knocks down, and at length</div>
<div class="verse">We eate him up. A Turkie’s very gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Like worldly people clad in fine array;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet on the Spit it looks most piteous,</div>
<div class="verse">And we devoure it, as the wormes eate us.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then full of sawce and zeale up steps <i>Elnathan</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">[This was his name now, once he had another,</div>
<div class="verse">Untill the Ducking-pond made him a Brother]</div>
<div class="verse">A Deacon, and a Buffeter of Sathan.</div>
<div class="sidenote">A man may love his brother</div>
<div class="verse">Truly, quoth he, I know a Brother deare,</div>
<div class="verse">Would gladly pick the bones of what’s left here.</div>
<div class="verse">Nay he would gladly pick your pockets too</div>
<div class="verse">Of a small two-pence, or a groat, or so,</div>
<div class="verse">The sorry remnants of a broken shilling;</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore I pray you friends be not unwilling.</div>
<div class="verse">But as for me, tis more than I doe need,</div>
<div class="verse">To be charitable both in word and deed;</div>
<div class="verse">For as to us, the holy Scriptures say,</div>
<div class="sidenote">but</div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Deacons must receive, the Lay-men pay.</i></div>
<div class="verse">Why Heathen folks that doe in Taverns stray,</div>
<div class="verse">Will never let their friends the reckning pay.</div>
<div class="verse">And therefore poure your charity into the bason,</div>
<div class="verse">Brethren and Sisters eke, your coats have lace on.</div>
<div class="verse">Why Brethren in the Lord, what need you care</div>
<div class="verse">For six pence? we’ll one houre enhance our ware.</div>
<div class="verse">Your six pence comes againe, nay there comes more;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus Charity’s th’ encreaser of your store.</div>
<div class="verse">Truly well spoke, then cry’d the Master-feaster,</div>
<div class="verse">Since you say so, here, you shall have my tester:</div>
<div class="verse">But for the women, they gave more liberally,</div>
<div class="verse">For they were sure to whom they gave, and why:</div>
<div class="sidenote">Not better than himselfe.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then did <i>Elnathan</i> blinke, for he knew well</div>
<div class="verse">What he might give, and what he might conceale.</div>
<div class="verse">But now the Parson could no longer stay,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis time to kiss, he cryes and so away.</div>
<div class="verse">At which the sisters, once th’ alarum tak’n,</div>
<div class="verse">Made such a din as would have serv’d to wak’n</div>
<div class="verse">A snoring brother, when he sleeps at Church;</div>
<div class="verse">With bagg and baggage then they gan to march;</div>
<div class="verse">And tickled with the thoughts of their delight,</div>
<div class="verse">One sister to the other bids Good night.</div>
<div class="verse">Good night quoth <i>Dorcas</i> to <i>Priscilla</i>, she,</div>
<div class="verse">Good night deare sister <i>Dorcas</i> unto thee.</div>
<div class="verse">In these goodly good nights much time was spent,</div>
<div class="verse">And was it not a holy complement?</div>
<div class="verse">At length in steps the Parson, on his breast</div>
<div class="sidenote">Christian Liberty.</div>
<div class="verse">Laying his hand. A happy night of rest</div>
<div class="verse">Reward thy labours sister: yet ere we part,</div>
<div class="verse">Feel in my lips the passion of my heart.</div>
<div class="verse">To another straight he turn’d his face, and kist her,</div>
<div class="verse">And then he cryes, <i>All peace be with thee Sister</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">To another in a godly tune he whines,</div>
<div class="sidenote">Nere a profane kisse among all these.</div>
<div class="verse">Deare Sister from thy lip Ile take my tines.</div>
<div class="verse">With that he kist, and whispers in her eare,</div>
<div class="verse">The time when it should be, and the place where.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus they all part, the Parson followes close,</div>
<div class="verse">For well the Parson knoweth where he goes.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This seem’d a golden time, the fall of sin,</div>
<div class="verse">You’d think the thousand years did now begin,</div>
<div class="verse">When Satan chain’d below should cease to roare,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor durst the wicked as they wont before</div>
<div class="verse">Come to the Church for pastime, nor durst laugh</div>
<div class="verse">To heare the non-plust Doctor faigne a cough.</div>
<div class="verse">The Devill himselfe, alas! now durst not stand</div>
<div class="verse">Within the switching of the Sextons wand,</div>
<div class="verse">For so a while the Priests did him pursue,</div>
<div class="verse">That he was faine to keep the Sabbath too,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest being taken in the Elders lure,</div>
<div class="verse">He should have paid his crown unto the poore;</div>
<div class="verse">And lest he should like a deceiver come</div>
<div class="verse">’Twixt the two Sundays <i>inter stitium</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">They stuft up Lecturers with texts and straw,</div>
<div class="verse">On working-dayes to keep the Devill in awe.</div>
<div class="verse">But strange to thinke, for all this solemn meeknesse,</div>
<div class="verse">At length the Devill appeared in his likenesse,</div>
<div class="verse">While these deceits did but supply the wants</div>
<div class="verse">Of broken unthrifts, and of thread-bare Saints.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Oh what will men not dare, if thus they dare</div>
<div class="verse">Be impudent to Heaven, and play with Prayer!</div>
<div class="verse">Play with that feare, with that religious awe</div>
<div class="verse">Which keeps men free, and yet is mans great law:</div>
<div class="verse">What can they but the worst of Atheists be,</div>
<div class="verse">Who while they word it ’gainst impiety,</div>
<div class="verse">Affront the throne of God with their false deeds,</div>
<div class="verse">Alas, this wonder in the Atheist breeds.</div>
<div class="verse">Are these the men that would the Age reforme,</div>
<div class="verse">That Down with Superstition cry, and swarme</div>
<div class="verse">This painted Glass, that Sculpture to deface,</div>
<div class="verse">But worship pride, and avarice in their place.</div>
<div class="verse">Religion they bawle out; yet know not what</div>
<div class="verse">Religion is, unlesse it be to prate.</div>
<div class="verse">Meeknesse they preach, but study to controule;</div>
<div class="verse">Mony they’d have, when they cry out the soule.</div>
<div class="verse">And angry, will not have Our Father said,</div>
<div class="verse">’Cause it prayes not enough for daily bread.</div>
<div class="verse">They meet in private, and cry Persecution,</div>
<div class="verse">When Faction is their end, and State-confusion,</div>
<div class="verse">These are the men that plague and over-run</div>
<div class="verse">Like Goths and Vandalls all Religion.</div>
<div class="verse">Every <i>Mechanick</i> either wanting stock</div>
<div class="verse">Or wit to keep his trade must have a flock.</div>
<div class="verse">The Spirit, cryes he, moveth me unto it,</div>
<div class="verse">And what the Spirit bids, must I not do it?</div>
<div class="verse">But having profited more than his flock by teaching,</div>
<div class="verse">And stept into authority by preaching</div>
<div class="verse">For a lay Office, leaves the Spirits motion</div>
<div class="verse">And straight retreateth from his first devotion.</div>
<div class="verse">But this he does in want, give him preferment,</div>
<div class="verse">Off goes his gowne, God’s call is no determent.</div>
<div class="verse">Vaine foolish people, how are ye deceiv’d?</div>
<div class="verse">How many severall sorts have ye receiv’d</div>
<div class="verse">Of things call’d truths, upon your backs lay’d on</div>
<div class="verse">Like saddles for themselves to ride upon?</div>
<div class="verse">They rid amaine, and hell and <i>Satan</i> drove,</div>
<div class="verse">While every Priest for his own profit strove.</div>
<div class="verse">Can they the age thus torture with their lyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Low’d bellowing to the world Impieties,</div>
<div class="verse">Black as their coates, and such a silent feare</div>
<div class="verse">Lock up the lips of men, and charme the eare?</div>
<div class="verse">Had that same holy Israelite bin dumb,</div>
<div class="verse">That fatall day of old had never come</div>
<div class="verse">To <i>Baals</i> Tribe, and thrice unhappy age</div>
<div class="verse">While zeale and piety like mask’d in rage</div>
<div class="verse">And vulgar ignorance. How we doe wonder</div>
<div class="verse">Once hearing, that the heavens were fir’d to thunder</div>
<div class="verse">Against assailing Gyants, surely men,</div>
<div class="verse">Men thought could not presume such violence then:</div>
<div class="verse">But ’twas no Fable, or if then it were,</div>
<div class="verse">Behold a sort of bolder mortals here,</div>
<div class="verse">Those undermining shifts of knavish folly,</div>
<div class="verse">Using alike to God and men most holy;</div>
<div class="verse">Infidels who now seem to have found out</div>
<div class="verse">A suttler way to bring their ends about.</div>
<div class="verse">Against the Deity then op’nly to fight</div>
<div class="verse">By smooth insinuation and by flight:</div>
<div class="verse">They close with God, seem to obey his Lawes,</div>
<div class="verse">They cry alowd for him and for his cause.</div>
<div class="verse">But while they doe their strict injunctions preach,</div>
<div class="verse">Deny in actions what their words doe teach.</div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>O what will men not dare, if thus they dare</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>Be impudent with Heaven, and play with Prayer!</i></div>
<div class="verse">Yet if they can no better teach than thus,</div>
<div class="verse">Would they would onely teach themselves, not us:</div>
<div class="verse">So while they still on empty out-sides dwell,</div>
<div class="verse">They may perhaps be choakt with husk and shell:</div>
<div class="verse">While those, who can their follies well refute,</div>
<div class="verse">By a true knowledge, doe obtaine the fruit.</div>
